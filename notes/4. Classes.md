## Classes

We know the rules by now, you have class *fields* which are the variables and are private to the class.  We have methods which are functions.  Public methods are those available to users of the class e.g. `myClass.method` and private ones are only accesible within the class.

You should build each class with the namespace of your program *?! I think ?!*

If you create a new class file (.cs) in the project folder, it will immediately be available to other .cs files in the folder. *?! I think ?!*

Each class should be its own file with the name of the file as the name of the class. (Good practice)

```cs
namespace GradeBook
{
    class Book
    {   
        //Some fields
        private double numberVariable
        private List listOfDoubles = new List(); //new empty list
        //Can't use var here

        //A method
        public void AddGrade(double Grade) 
        //public for access outside the class
        //void means it doesn't return anything *?! I think ?!*
        {
            listOfDoubles.Add(43.5);
        }
    }
}

```
### Construtor method

Just write a method with the same name as the class, with no return type.
```cs
namespace GradeBook
{
    class Book
    {   
        private List<double> listOfDoubles;

        public Book() 
        {
            listOfDoubles = new List<double>());
        }
    }
}
```
You can assign parameters to a constructor, so that when an instance is created, the user has to provide the parameter.  You can then do what you want with the parameter value in the constructor.

```cs
namespace GradeBook
{
    class Book
    {   
        private string name;

        public Book(string name) 
        {
            this.name = name;
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, you can also the `this` keyword to refer to the current **object**.  In this example it prevents the complier getting confused between two variables called `name`, but makes it easier to read with them both being just called `name`.

Without `this`, the compiler assumes that the *nearest* definition of `name` is the one being referred to - in the above example the nearest definition is in the parameter to the constructor method.

You can leave it off most of the time, unless there is a name conflict.


### Access modifiers
This is what we call the keywords that control access e.g.
```cs
public  //it's accesible outside the class
private //it's only accesible within the class
        //this limits the potential for things to go wrong 
        //by preventing things like illegal value entry
static  //it relates to the class, not to instances of the class
internal//it can only be used within the current project
```
If you omit one fo these, it defaults to `private` for a method in a class.  For the class itself it defaults to `internal`.  You will need to change the class to `public` to use it outside the project.

> `Static` members, like the main method in the program class, are not methods you can use on an instance of a class.  For example, if you create an instance of a class `Book` with the follow:

```cs
static main();
{
    //some code
}
public action();
{
    //some code
}
```

The following rules would apply.

```cs
Book instanceOfBook = new Book();
instanceOfBook.action();    //This is fine
Book.action();              //This won't run
instanceOfBook.main();      //This won't run
Book.main();                //However this will.
```
You can also have static fields.  

Static members exist only once in a program because the class only exists once.  Public and private members will exist for each instance of the class.

Static members are less common since they negate the object-oriented aspect of the approach.  They are commonly useful for example, in a 'toolbox'-type class.

`Program.Main` is static.  `Console.WriteLine()` is also static.

Another example is when you are finding the highest value in a list.  If you want to start a variable off with as low a value as possible, depending on the numeric type you are using, you can using a static member of the numeric type class:

```cs
double number = 1.2;
double highGrade = double.MinValue;
//MinValue is a static member of the double class
highGrade = Math.Max(number,highGrade); 
//Max is also a static member of the Math class
```

### Auto generate method in VS Code

If you are planning to create a new method, you can write the implementation of the method and use a vscode shortcut to create it.  You just type how you want to use it then hit `Ctrl+.`

```cs
Book.newMethod();   //Write this, the hit Ctrl+.
```
