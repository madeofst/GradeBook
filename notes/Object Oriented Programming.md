### The Three Pillars of OOP

1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism

In this guy's opinion, inheritance is over-rated, which sort of makes sense to me.  I don't really know what polymorphism is, but I sort of get the idea.  Encapsulation is putting stuff in functions/methods essentially.

> DRY PRINCIPLE - Don't repeat yourself
