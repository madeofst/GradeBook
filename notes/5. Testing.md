## Unit Testing

This is probably a good idea, but I probably want to be careful not to do this religiously and automatically.

To run tests effectively/efficiently, you generally want to use an external library such as **xUnit** for C#.

### Folder structure

Generally things are arrange as follows:

```cs
gradebook\  src\    GradeBook        //relevant files for main program in here
            test\   GradeBook.Tests  //relevant testing files in here
```

Within GradeBook.Tests, dotnet can automatically create the relevant files an include the relevant references for you, all you need to type in the CLI (once you've navigated to the relevant folder) is:

```cli
dotnet new xunit
```

### XUnit

You can use NuGet to get it, but the dotnet set up does this automatically.  It adds a reference to the package into the GradeBook.Tests.csproj file.  This is where the `#include`s are.

### Built-in dotnet test runner
Often a tool like VSCode has a test runner built-in or as an extension, but you also have one as part of the dotnet environment.  To run it, all you do is (from the Gradebook.Tests folder):

```cli
dotnet test
```

### An aid in refactoring decisions

One argument for unit testing is that it helps you make good design decisions, and refactor things where appropriate in order to get sensible results from the tests.
