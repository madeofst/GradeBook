## List
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1?view=netcore-3.1


List are basically dynamic arrays, behaving a bit like a vb collection, so can be added to easily. It is a class so is declared as follows:

```cs
List<double> listName;
```

For lists (unlike array) you don't have to set a size for to instantiate it. To instantiate as an empty list:

```cs
List<double> listName = new List<double>();
//Can also pass initial values
List<double> listName = new List<double>(){2.1, 3.1};
```

Using var (like a c++ auto) here makes it simpler without sacrificing clarity on the type which is made clear when it's instantiated in the same statement.

```cs
var listName = new List<double>();
```

### Methods of list

Add
```cs
List<double> listName = new List<double>(){2.1, 3.1};
listName.Add(22.4);
listName.Add(22.4);
```
Count
```cs
List<double> listName = new List<double>(){2.1, 3.1};
int length = listName.Count;
Console.WriteLine($"The length of the list is {length:N1}");
```
The N1 is a formatting specifier, of which there are many in C#:
